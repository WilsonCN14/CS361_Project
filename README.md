# CS361_Project

This project is a website where a user can learn about various medical drug topics and quiz themselves on what they learned. This project is for my Software Engineering class to practice producing content for other people's projects and consuming content from other people's projects. Microservices are used to produce and consume content.

My project consumes a web scraper microservice (not implemented yet - currently, I copy and pasted information)

My project produces a clock microservice where the client requests what time it will be later (for example, they can request what time it will be in 4 hours).

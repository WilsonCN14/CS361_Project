# CS361 Project: Medical Drug Learning Website

This project is a website where a user can learn about various medical drug topics and quiz themselves on what they learned. This project is for my Software Engineering class to practice producing content for other people's projects and consuming content from other people's projects. Microservices are used to produce and consume content.

My project consumes a web scraper microservice.

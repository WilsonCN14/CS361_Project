# CS361_Project

I'm currently working on figuring out exactly what I want my project to be. I'm thinking about making a program that helps users learn about various drugs or basic medicine facts. The program could have categories, like Antihistamines or Anticoagulants, and when the user clicks on a category, the most important drugs and facts about that category shows up followed by a quiz to see how well they learned the information. 

This will be part of a group project where I create a service someone else will use and consume a service someone else produces. I am currently figuring out what services I will produce/consume.
